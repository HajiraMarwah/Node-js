What is Buffering in nodejs
  1. Buffer is a temporary storage area for binary data
  2.Node js doesnt not support  direct binary manipulation like c/c++ so buffer  provides a way to work directly with byte
  3. used mostly in file streams,network data and binary protocols

why do we need Buffers
  1. JavaScript string are utf-16 encoded making direct binary data handling inefficient
  2. Buffer store this binary data outside v8's heaap
  3.Useful when working with 
      - File systems(fs module)
      - Networking(TCP,UDP,WebSocket)
      - Streams(handling chunks of data)


Example

    const buffer = Buffer.from("Hello");
    console.log(buffer); // <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f>
