Node.js Overview

Definition

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s V8
engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server
side, outside of a browser.

Why We Use Node.js

-   To build fast, scalable server-side applications.
-   To use JavaScript on both frontend and backend.
-   To handle real-time applications like chat, games, and streaming.
-   To work with event-driven, non-blocking I/O for high performance.

Advantages

-   Fast performance due to the V8 engine.
-   Non-blocking, asynchronous architecture.
-   Single programming language across full stack.
-   Large NPM ecosystem.
-   Excellent for real-time apps.
-   Scales easily with microservices.

Disadvantages

-   Not ideal for CPU-intensive tasks.
-   Callback hell (although improved with Promises & async/await).
-   Fewer established enterprise tools compared to Java or .NET.
-   Single-threaded nature can be a limitation for heavy computations.
