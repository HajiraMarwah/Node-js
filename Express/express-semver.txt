SemVer (Semantic Versioning)

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning system used to manage and
communicate changes in software. It follows the format:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1. MAJOR Version

-   Increases when there are incompatible api changes or breaking changes are introduced.
-   means old code will stop working
-   Example: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

2. MINOR Version

-   Increases when new features are added but in backward‑compatible way(nothing will break).
-   Example: 1.2.0 → 1.3.0

3. PATCH Version

-   Increases when bug fixes or small improvements** are released in backward‑compatible way.
-   Example: 1.2.3 → 1.2.4

Summary

-   MAJOR = Breaking changes
-   MINOR = New backward‑compatible features
-   PATCH = Bug fixes / small updates
