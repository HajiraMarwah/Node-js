Express.js Overview

What is Express?

Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible web framework for Node.js.
It simplifies building server-side applications, APIs, and web services
by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and HTTP
handling.

Uses of Express.js

-   Building RESTful APIs
-   Creating web applications
-   Handling routing efficiently
-   Integrating middleware for authentication, logging, parsing, etc.
-   Serving static files
-   Building backend services for microservices architecture

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages of Express.js

1.  Minimal and Flexible
    -   Provides only what you need; everything else can be added with
        middleware.
2.  Large Ecosystem
    -   Hundreds of middleware packages available.
3.  Fast Development
    -   Simple APIs and structure help developers build apps quickly.
4.  Easy Routing System
    -   Clean, powerful routing for building multipage or API-based
        apps.
5.  Great Community Support
    -   Widely used and well-documented.
6.  Works Seamlessly with Node.js
    -   Built on top of Node, leveraging its asynchronous, event-driven
        nature.

Disadvantages of Express.js

1.  Not Opinionated
    -   No strict structure — beginners may feel lost without
        guidelines.
2.  Middleware Overload
    -   Too many third‑party packages; quality varies.
3.  Callback Hell (in older versions)
    -   Requires proper async handling (promises/async‑await solve
        this).
4.  Security Needs Extra Attention
    -   Must add security middlewares (Helmet, rate‑limit, etc.)
        manually.
5.  Lacks Built‑in Features
    -   No built‑in ORM, authentication, validation, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

Express.js is powerful and widely used because of its speed, simplicity,
and flexibility.
However, the lack of strict structure and reliance on middleware can be
challenging for beginners.
