HTTP-hyper text transfer protocol for transfering infromation on internet
when we talk about api or interbet or serer
when client(machine,mobile,laptop) 
server(it can be machine connectd to internet having public ip address,public facing ip ,aws,azure,goggle server or can be bare metal(server that is present in our home or office))
its 27/7 ouptime has public facing ip static ip assume it has ip address of 10.24.1.2

this client send request(create,upload or anything) to server and server is responsible for processing this request(like get,post delete the data) at this paoint as part of proceessing first of all you have to authenticate(if particular user allowed to access),authorization
(access that particular resouce,authority like validation check) and finally process this processing can be database opeartion
your server can be connected to database(postgres,mongodb or mysql) and its do some read and write operatio in database

and once ths server has done ots work it going return response means at end its request and response this is known as request-response cycle


What is HTTP?
-   HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
-   It is the primary protocol used for transferring information on the
    internet.
-   Works on a request–response model.

Client
-   Can be any device sending a request: mobile, laptop, machine,
    browser.

Server
-   A computer connected to the internet with a public-facing IP
    address.
-   Can be hosted on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, on-prem bare-metal, etc.
-   Example public IP: 10.24.1.2.
-   Always running (24/7 uptime).

What Happens When a Client Sends a Request?

1.  Request reaches server (GET/POST/DELETE etc.).
2.  Server performs:
    -   Authentication (Is the user allowed?)
    -   Authorization (What resource can they access?)
    -   Validation of data.
3.  Server processes the operation:
    -   Read/write means server  connected to database  (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) do some operations 
4.  Server sends back a response to client.

Request–Response Cycle
-   Client → sends a request
-   Server → processes
-   Server → sends response
-   This loop is called Request–Response Cycle.

HTTP Methods-Requests which client sends
GET
-   Used to retrieve data.
-   Example: Fetch user profile, product list.

POST
-   Used to create new data.
-   Example: Create user, submit form.

PUT
-   Used to update existing data completely.
-   Example: Replace the entire user object.

PATCH
-   Used to partially update data.
-   Example: Only update user email.

DELETE
-   Used to remove data.
-   Example: Delete user or product.

-   202 Accepted – Request accepted but not yet processed.
-   204 No Content – Request successful, no response body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3xx – Redirection

-   301 Moved Permanently – Resource moved to a new URL.
-   302 Found – Temporary redirect.
-   304 Not Modified – Cached version can be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4xx – Client Errors

-   400 Bad Request – Invalid request format.
-   401 Unauthorized – Authentication required.
-   403 Forbidden – You are not allowed to access.
-   404 Not Found – Resource not found.
-   409 Conflict – Request conflicts with server state.
